This script processes human-annotated non-structured descriptions from a CSV
file. It loads the raw annotation data, filters for specific description
columns, replaces any "unknown" values with NaN, sorts the entries by video ID,
and saves the cleaned and ordered data to a new CSV file for further analysis.
